# Random Quote Generator Server

The goal here is to create a NestJS server application that will keep and deliver quotes of:

- Movies
- Animes
- Series

This quotes will be receiving from public API's like:

- <https://strangerthings-quotes.vercel.app>
- <https://the-one-api.dev>
- <https://animechan.vercel.app>
- <https://web-series-quotes-api.deta.dev/redoc>

In this project I will be using PrismaORM.
